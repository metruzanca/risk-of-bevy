# Risk of Bevy
A really bad Risk of Rain 2 clone for learning purposes.

## Goals / planned features:
- [ ] 3rd person camera
- [ ] commando survivor
- [ ] basic director to spawn beetles, wisps and lemurians
- [ ] some items
- [ ] teleporter w/ a boss.
- [ ] game ends after first stage
- [ ] Wasm build for easy distribution

This should give me a pretty good understanding of the bevy engine.
